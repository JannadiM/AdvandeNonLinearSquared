Description: Takes in x and y vectors and returns the coefficients a and b of the model created. Also calculates the predicted values and plots the curve of the model. Data example: x = c(1:14) ; y = c(1880,813,376,161,100,61,31,9,8,2,7,4,3,2). Using this packages you don't need to specify the start points (a and b), they are actually predicted.
